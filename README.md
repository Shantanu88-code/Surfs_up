# Surfs_up

# Analysis Overview:

We are looking to invest in new Surf n Shake shop in Oahu and have approached W.Avy who is surfer and also potential investor. We have analysed weather patterns over the months and previous years. W.Avy also wants to determine the temparatures for the month of June and December to decide whether the venture would be sustainable throughout the year

# Results:

For this analysis, we merged and compared temparature statistics for June and December. The following table shows weather patterns over June and December.

# Few points to consider:

1. The average temparature in June is 75 and 71 in December. It is a moderate temparature and there is not much difference between two periods. With the help of bar graph below, it can be seen that temparatures over the years have been steady for both June and December with just a slight difference between the two.

2. Also, when we look at maximum temparatures, there is not much difference either with 85 in June and 83 in December.

3. However, if we look at minimum temparature, there is considerable amount of difference between June and December with 64 and 56 respectively. Minimum temprature in December may not be suitable for surfing and ice creams. The standard deviation of 3.75 states the statistics are built around average temparature.

4. The following two images would help to understand the temparature and precipitation patterns over the years.

# Summary:

To summarize, there is no significant temparature difference in both months and with average temparaure over the years being fine for surfing and enjoying ice creams. Also, with the help of histograms, it can be seen that for June the median temparature is around 77 with the frequency of around 200 and about 72 for Decemebr with highest frequency of around 350.

It looks fine to invest in the shop. But before making the final decision, we can consider few points:

1. There are few factors other than temparature, precipitation being the one. It would be great if we can collect data on frequencies. Also, we have to consider the response of people, number of activities available. Also, we can analyse statistics of temparatures recorded by stations for those two months to determine the location in Oahu.
